# monochrome-hyprland
My own hyprland-related configuration files that embrace monochromatic, CLI-like tiled window manager workspace design.

# Isn't it kind of bland?
Yes, and this is how it should look like. Styling options that are present in this repository are designed to be easier for your eyes at night and feel not instrusive while working on something. All those flashy riced setups you see on the internet are usually kind of impractical, at least for me, so I decided to make a practical one, which suites me the best.

# Warning âš 
This repository is currently in development phase and will be updated constantly. Expect frequent updates and breaking changes
